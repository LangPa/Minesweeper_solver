# Minesweeper Solver

A simple minesweeper python program to test the effectiveness various machine learning algorithms.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. 
Users can currently play minesweeper in the console, no flagging system has been implemented as of yet.

## Reflection
 
This is my first machine learning project designed to complete a rudimentary task. The goal of the project is primarily familiarise myself with git, python and proper documentation.
There are a few issues with how it is coded including the long run time to generate a minefield with a high density of mines, I am not too fussed about that however as the main goal is just to familiarise myself with coding and machine learning.
